# FormTestFileReader
Plan files format generator

The purpose of this application is generate plain files from a specific format.
The formats are created by the user in the application setting each column of the file.
You can also load the data in each column and export it as a plain text file.

By using serialization you can save the progress of your created formats, so you didn't lose them when you close the application.

## TODO
+ Improve Serialization Process to do it asynchronously.
